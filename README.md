# NpBot-v2
Rewrite of a discord bot.
Haven't put everything on here yet oof

# How to set it up
Process the script in IFOscript by using "File > Process" then once it's done, click "Finalize as .ifof" and save it. Then Change the batch script to point to wherever the .ifof is saved and run the batch script. Use the GUI's instructions to set the rest up and get the bot connected to an account (right now it only works as a userbot). Once you've invited the bot to your server, run "=setup" and use the provided walkthrough to set everything up. To change staff roles, use "=staffrole [new role mention]" and say "Yes"
